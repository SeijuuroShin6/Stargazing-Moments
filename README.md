How Stargazing Moments came up ? Well, 
______________________________________


The 3rd August 2018 Travis Scott released his 3rd Studio Album called, ASTROWORLD and the first song of the album is "STARGAZING".
And when the Album dropped, I was on RapGenius to understand the lyrics and the meanning of the song and the word STARGAZING.
According to RapGenius Stargazing, is a song describing the experience of an unpredictable psychedelic trip.
The song title could be a reference to Houston’s iconic ties to astrological exploration, with NASA’s Mission Control Center being located in Travis’s hometown.

That song was first previewed on his Snapchat account on April 13, 2018, and I just get my first degree in Software Engineering the 16th April 2024, after presenting this projet 
STARGAZING MOMENTS.
